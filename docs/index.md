### What and Why?

I had scattered sets of bookmarks/links in various places and pretty common situations were that I just simply lost my links. This was very embarrasing and I started to search how I can store all my resources in some centralized system.

I was lucky and found [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

Here is aggregated links and usefull resources database for (web) developers.

Feel free to use this information in any ways (including repo cloning). If you would like something to add to the KnowledgeBase, just create a pull request after editing `*.md` files in `./docs` folder. [Use the `main` branch](https://github.com/dainiuxt/kb)!

### Some Docs Databases

[Dev Encyclopedia](https://devpedia.pages.dev/)

[DevDocs API Documentation](https://devdocs.io/)

> DevDocs combines multiple API documentations in a fast, organized, and searchable interface.
